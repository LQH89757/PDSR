## :fire: News

- [2026/03/26] We have released part of the code, and the full version will be available soon.
- [2026/03/24] Our paper has been accepted to MedIA.

## :rocket: Overview

Here's a framework overview of our **PDSR** method:

## 🛠️ Prepare your own dataset

To get started with PDSR, follow the instructions below.

1. Enter the data directory

```
cd ./PDSR_for_Training/datasets
```

2. Organize the data in the following format
```
Your Dataset/
├── trainA/
│ ├── xxx.png
│ ├── xxx.png
│ └── ...
├── trainB/
│ ├── xxx.png
│ └── ...
├── testA/
│ ├── xxx.png
│ └── ...
└── testB/
├── xxx.png
└── ...
```

### :blue_book: Example Usage

1. Training
```
cd ./PDSR_for_Training
```

```sh
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 train.py --dataroot datasets/dataset'name
```

2. Testing

```
cd ./PDSR_for_Inferencing
```

Place the trained checkpoints in the current directory

```sh
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 test.py --dataroot datasets/dataset'name
```
